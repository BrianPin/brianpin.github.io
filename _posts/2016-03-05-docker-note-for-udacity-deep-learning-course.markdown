title: Docker Installation For Deep Learning Course
---
# 1. Introduction
I have always been wondering to learn the Course of Deep Learning. So I started
to learn the Udacity course ud730. And the first significant hump I met is the
install of docker. From my understanding docker is just a Linux process. But I
found the whole docker community is way more complex and interesting. Here in
this note, I just want to write down knowledges about Docker when I was installing
tensorflow assignment.
